# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Books is a website where you can leave reviews for books you've read.
It was built with Python using Flask and PostgreSQL.
It uses the Goodreads API to get information on the average rating for a book and the total number of ratings left for a book. 
The HTML is mostly Jinja2 and the CSS is mostly Bootstrap.

Using Books, you can:
  create a user profile
  search for your favorite books and authors
  see information for books like title, author, year published, isbn, average Goodreads rating, 
  leave a review out of 5 stars as well as a written review
  view reviews left for a book by other users
  see all of the reviews left by a specific user
  see all of the reviews you've left via your profile
  delete reviews you've left
